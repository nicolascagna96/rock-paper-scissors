## Introduction

In this project I replicated the famous rock, paper and scissors game.  It is a game originated from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

## UX
### User Stories
- The user will be asked to provide his/her name.
- The user will be informed about the rules of the game.
-  The user will have to follow the rules and win the game.
### User Goals
The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules: 
- Rock wins against scissors.
- Scissors win against paper.
- Paper wins against rock.
The user needs to win the game against the computer.

## Logic
I created a flowchart of the game.
